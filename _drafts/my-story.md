Throughout my journey, I've been fortunate to have many incredible mentors who have advised me and helped me get to this point. Even still, there is a lack of transparency about the paths we take, especially in academia. As the first person in my family to pursue a PhD, I learned a lot throughout internet-stalking, trying to piece together people's journeys. As an immigrant, the feeling of being lost and befuddled by opaque, unnecessarily complicated systems is not new to me. My hope with this page is to detail my journey and especially to emphasize 1) the role of both privilege and luck and 2) the ever-present non-linearity of my journey. I hope this will be helpful to others who are trying to find a path that seems best for them. 

### Immigrating to the US
I was born in Calcutta, India and immigrated to the US when I was seven years old. I consider being Indian-American one of the greatest gifts of my life; though my experience as an immigrant has been far from easy, it has imbued me with certain inherent inclinations, including a tendency to question the systems that govern our lives, a deep love of community, especially integenerational communities, and the audacity to dream big. Throughout my childhood, my parents instilled in me a sense of resilience ("We will always find a way" was a common mantra in our family) and gave me their unconditional support. I would not be who I am without their love, and for that I am so grateful. 

### College Education
After graduating from high school, I attended Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering. It still feels a little crazy to be able to say that; I applied to Olin on a whim because the only female mentor for my high school robotics team persuaded me to do so. I applied, preparing myself for the heartbreak of inevitable rejection. I am still grateful to this mentor (and my parents) for pushing me to pursue my biggest dreams.

Getting to go to Olin is another one of the greatest gifts of my life thus far. Olin was far from perfect but created the perfect environment for me to thrive and grow in ways that I don't think another college could've provided. The summer reading book before my first year was Weapons of Math Destruction by Dr. Cathy O'Neil. I remember being absolutely engrossed by the book's depiction of the discriminatory impacts of algorithms. That seeded an early interest in understanding the ways that computing perpetuates harms that my faculty and peers at Olin helped bloom into my current research interests.

Early in my time at Olin, I connected with Prof. Erhardt Graeff. Working with Prof. Graeff and other amazing Olin students, I co-founded PInT, a student-led public interest technology clinic. This was one of the best educational experiences of my life; not only did I make some great friends and get to tangibly shape Olin in a permanent way, I got the experience the transformative effects of building and being part of a truly inclusive community. 

Through PInT, I also began to pursue research after an experience directly confronting how myopic, techno-solutionist logics can easily lead to irreparable computational harms. My first real research experience was researching "design refusal", or the practice of refusing to design or build technology because of its potential ethical harms. I had no idea what I was doing the entire time, but Prof. Graeff provided incredible mentorship and I quickly fell in love with research. As I developed confidence as a researcher, I decided to pursue an independent senior thesis exploring the characteristics of feminist technologists and the types of experiences that develop feminist technologists. These early research experiences have instilled a love for critical theory, interdisciplinary approaches, and qualitative research in me. 

Aside from my academic work, my community of peers at Olin have fundamentally shaped me. I was lucky enough to be an active member of Olin Student Government for a couple years, serving as President for one year. I struggled with deep imposter syndrome during that year, especially as a historically very shy and awkward kid. Becoming a steward of the community that I loved so much was an incredible experience. 

To be transparent, my time at Olin wasn't all amazing. I also struggled with mental health issues that tend to manifest in your early 20s, which were exacerbated by the pandemic and interpersonal issues (like a few truly devastating friend break-ups and romantic break-ups). These experiences seem very commonplace, but they fundamentally shaped my time at Olin and my ability to do research. I think I was ultimately successful because of my support system of parents, mentors, and friends who gave me love when I couldn't give it to myself.

### Post-College

After graduating from my undergrad, I spent a summer interning at Microsoft Research in the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) research group, mentored by Dr. Koustuv Saha. Getting this internship was a real full-circle moment for me. The first internship I applied to in undergrad was a software engineering internship at Microsoft, which I was offered but ultimately couldn't take due to visa issues. At the time, that broke my heart and I thought I'd never get a similar opportunity again. Three years later, I had an even better opportunity -- which goes to show how the things that are meant for us will come to us naturally (though not effortlessly and certainly not without some systemic privilege -- I was privileged to come from a really good undergrad institution with very close relationships to my faculty mentors).
