I am a socio-technical researcher and a critical techno-realist. I use interdisciplinary approaches with a critical orientation to understand how technology perpetuates existing systems of oppression and enables new kinds of oppression and identify the necessary social, technical, and legal guardrails to prevent harm. I draw heavily from fields like human-computer interaction, critical data/algorithmic studies, science and technology studies, computer-supported cooperative work, and other fields. My ultimate goal as a researcher and technologist is to orient computing towards the public interest, which I believe requires positing computing in its place and understanding how it can advance social justice and prevent it from perpetuating harm.

I received a B.S. in Computing from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in 2022, where I researched design refusal and feminist computing with Prof. Erhardt Graeff and co-founded a student-led public interest technology club called [PInT](pint.olin.edu). After graduation, I interned at Microsoft Research Montreal in the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) group, working with Dr. Koustuv Saha to identify socio-technical interventions to better support meaningful consent to workplace wellbeing sensing technologies. Since then, I have been working in the tech industry as a software engineer.

I will be a PhD student at the University of Michigan's School of Information in Fall 2023, advised by Profs. Ben Green and Nazanin Andalibi.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading (especially romance, memoirs and other non-fiction, fantasy, and cozy mysteries), cross-stitching, running, exploring local parks, biking, working out, and trying out new recipes -- recommendations welcome :)
