I am a socio-technical researcher and a critical techno-realist. My research agenda comprises of two main parts: first, understanding and addressing the precise sources of socio-technical harms and second, re-asserting explicit politics of social justice into computing. I use interdisciplinary approaches with a critical orientation to identify how technology fits into and perpetuates existing systems of oppression and the necessary social, technical, and legal guardrails to prevent harm. My ultimate goal as a researcher and technologist is to orient computing towards the public interest.

I received a B.S. in Computing from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in 2022, where I researched design refusal and feminist computing with Prof. Erhardt Graeff and co-founded a student-led public interest technology club called [PInT](pint.olin.edu). After Olin, I was an intern at Microsoft Research Montreal in the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) group, working with Dr. Koustuv Saha. Since then, I've been working in the tech industry as a software engineer and will be a PhD student at University of Michigan's School of Information in Fall 2023, advised by Prof. Ben Green and Prof. Nazanin Andalibi.
